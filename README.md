# HB_Intro_Project
My Final Project at Hackbright Academy

Analyzed the number of cars on the 237 Express Lanes Westbound and Eastbound direction. This dataset contained 57,000 rows of data in .csv file. 
I used Python program to answer the following questions below:

- Which month has the most number of cars?
- Which week has the most number of cars?
- Which day has the most number of cars?
- Which hour has the most number of cars?
- Which direction has the most number of cars?
